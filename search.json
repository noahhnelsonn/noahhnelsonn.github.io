    "section": "",
    "text": "The 2011 college football season was filled with up and downs through out the entirety of it and many questioned the BCS system that was put in place and it definitely had its flaws.\nOne of the biggest issues that it had was the ability to accurately pick the two correct teams to play in the BCS National Championship game. Many saw issues with this and with this being an issue every season, this led to the eventual College Football Playoffs.\nThe 2011 National Championship was different though and it was hard to decide who would be playing LSU in the National Championship. There were three choices many thought deserved to make it. The Boise State Broncos, The Alabama Crimson Tide, and the Oklahoma State Cowboys.\nThe Tide were the eventual pick, but were they the correct one? We will look into it, First, we’ll look into the SRS rating and this is created by taking the average point differential for given team and strength of schedule.\nWe compare these three schools with the AP top ten teams at the end of the 2011 season.\n\n\nCode\nwarning(FALSE)\n\n\nWarning: FALSE\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\n\nWarning: package 'cowplot' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\nCode\nteamratings &lt;- read_csv(\"data/teamratings.csv\")\n\ntop10ratings&lt;-teamratings |&gt;\n filter(School==\"Alabama\"|School==\"LSU\"|School==\"Oklahoma State\"|School==\"Oregon\"|School==\"Arkansas\"|School==\"USC\"|School==\"Stanford\"|School==\"Boise State\"|School==\"South Carolina\"|School==\"Wisconsin\") \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=top10ratings, \n    aes(y=reorder(School, OSRS), x=OSRS, xend=DSRS),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"Gray\",\n    colour_x = \"Blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"Orange\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"SRS Difference\",\n    title=\"The tale of the tape..SRS Edition \",\n    subtitle = \"SRS is a rating that takes into account average point differential and strength of schedule.  &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;OSRS&lt;/span&gt; is offense &lt;span style = 'color:orange;'&gt;DSRS&lt;/span&gt; is for defense\",\n    y = \"\",\n    caption = \" Source: www.SRCFB.com | By: Noah Nelson \"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\nWarning: Using the `size` aesthetic with geom_segment was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` aesthetic instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe more balanced teams on this graph are the ones that are closer together and the dumbbell chart shows that Boise State is by far the most balanced of the three.\nAlabama and Oklahoma State were quite opposites with Alabama having a better overall defense with a weaker offense and the Cowboys having the better offense with a weaker defense. This makes sense because of the offensive power that has lied in the Big 12 for a long time and the hard nose defense the SEC always brings.\nLooking at that we can see specific categories on offense and see what each of these teams were good at specifically.\n\n\nCode\nteamoffense &lt;- read_csv(\"data/teamoffense.csv\")\n\ntop10offense&lt;-teamoffense |&gt;\n

Weeden was a vet qb who was the oldest player drafted in the first round of the NFL Draft.\nAlabama had the better rushing offense and they have had a long line of elite backs to back that up. They were led by top five NFL Draft pick Trent Richardson and had other backs such as Eddie Lacy and Jalston Fowler.\nBoise State remained at the middle ground of the top ten teams and had the most balance offense out of the three teams.\nNow lets look at defensive stats and the teams’ average passing and rushing yards per game.\n\n\nCode\nteamdefense &lt;- read_csv(\"data/teamdefense.csv\")\n\ntop10defense&lt;-teamdefense |&gt;\n filter(School==\"Alabama\"|School==\"LSU\"|School==\"Oklahoma State\"|School==\"Oregon\"|School==\"Arkansas\"|School==\"USC\"|School==\"Stanford\"|School==\"Boise State\"|School==\"South Carolina\"|School==\"Wisconsin\")\n\nald &lt;- top10defense|&gt;\n  filter(School == \"Alabama\")\n\nlsud &lt;- top10defense|&gt;\n  filter(School == \"LSU\")\n\noksd &lt;- top10defense|&gt;\n  filter(School == \"Oklahoma State\")\n\nbsud &lt;- top10defense|&gt;\n  filter(School == \"Boise State\")\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(data=teamdefense, aes(x=PassingAVYARDS, y=RushingYDSG), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=top10defense, aes(x=PassingAVYARDS, y=RushingYDSG), color=\"black\")+\n  geom_point(data=ald, aes(x=PassingAVYARDS, y=RushingYDSG), color=\"maroon\")+\n  geom_point(data=lsud, aes(x=PassingAVYARDS, y=RushingYDSG), color=\"purple\")+\n  geom_point(data=oksd, aes(x=PassingAVYARDS, y=RushingYDSG), color=\"orange\")+\n    geom_point(data=bsud, aes(x=PassingAVYARDS, y=RushingYDSG), color=\"blue\")+\n   geom_smooth(data=teamdefense, aes(x=PassingAVYARDS, y=RushingYDSG), method = \"lm\", se=FALSE)+\n    geom_text_repel(data=ald, aes(x=PassingAVYARDS, y=RushingYDSG, label=School))+\n    geom_text_repel(data=lsud, aes(x=PassingAVYARDS, y=RushingYDSG, label=School))+\n    geom_text_repel(data=oksd, aes(x=PassingAVYARDS, y=RushingYDSG, label=School))+\n    geom_text_repel(data=bsud, aes(x=PassingAVYARDS, y=RushingYDSG, label=School))+\n    labs(\n    x=\"Avg Defensive Passing Yards per game\", \n    y=\"Avg Defensive Rushing Yards per game\", \n    title=\"Defense wins championships and Bama shines\", \n    subtitle=\"Stopping the opposition through the air and on the ground = more wins\", \n    caption=\"Source: www.SRCFB.com | By: Noah Nelson\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal()+\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face= \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=10),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow. Alabama had and elite defense.\nAlabama by far had the best overall defense out of the three teams compared against LSU and it shows that they deserved to be in it more than the Broncos and the Cowboys.\nBoise State has always been a Group of five team to always have to consider when looking at the National Championship game and now with the present day extended playoff, hopefully they will get that chance.\nIt is safe to say that the 2011 college football season was always going to be one to remember."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There is no doubt that Leverkusen had an unforgettable season in the 2023-2024 season. The Lions completed a perfect season and didn’t take a single loss throughout league play.\nSoccer phenomena have wondered how they accomplished this and have questioned the team’s legitimacy. Players like Victor Boniface, Florian Wirtz, and Bundesliga assist leader Alex Grimaldo led the elite offense.\nLet’s put this theory to the test.\nThe first we’ll look at is goals and expected goals to see how Leverkusen did compared to other squads in league play.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nbundesligagoals &lt;- read_csv(\"data/xpgoalsbundesliga.csv\")\n\nbundesligagoalswide &lt;- bundesligagoals |&gt; \n  group_by(Squad) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    Totalxg = sum(xG),\n    Totalgoals = sum(Gls)\n  )\n\nlongbundesliga &lt;- bundesligagoalswide |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Total\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"goals\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=longbundesliga, aes(x=reorder(Squad,goals), weight=goals, fill=Type)) +\n  coord_flip() + \n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = \"Legend\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"black\")) +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Goals\",\n    x = \"Squad\",\n    title = \"Bayer Leverkusen were hard to stop in league play\",\n    subtitle = \"The Lions have made the most out of there shot chances\",\n    caption=\"Source: www.FBRef.com | By: Noah Nelson\") +\n   theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank() \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayer Leverkusen has been able to convert more goals than what they were expected. This means that they were taking shots or given chances that they were not supposed to have and ended up converting on some of them.\nThe offense for Leverkusen can be described in one word: Elite.\nThe Lions were able to connect and were able to outscore their expected goals, and this would be pivotal towards their undefeated season.\nIt creates yet another question to test the reigning Bundesliga champion’s offense.\nHow often were they creating chances for themselves, and how many of the passes were able to lead to goal opportunities?\n\n\nCode\ngcabundesliga&lt;- read_csv(\"data/gcabundesliga.csv\")\ngcaleverkusen&lt;- gcabundesliga |&gt; filter(Squad==\"Leverkusen\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = gcabundesliga, aes(x = SCA, y = GCA),color=\"black\") + \n  geom_point(data = gcaleverkusen, aes(x = SCA, y = GCA),color=\"red\") +\n  geom_smooth(data = gcabundesliga, aes(x = SCA, y = GCA), method=\"lm\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=gcabundesliga, aes(x= SCA, y= GCA, label= Squad)) +\n    labs(title = \"Are the Lions creating shots and converting them?\",\n       subtitle = \"Creating chances were the least of Leverkusens worries in Bundesliga play \",\n       caption=\"Source: www.FBRef.com | By: Noah Nelson\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeverkusen were able to create chances for their elite offensive players, and from what the stats show, they were able to convert on most of the chances they were given.\nGCA is determined by looking at the two passes leading directly before a goal is scored, and SCA is determined by looking at the two passes leading to a shot. Only one team was able to create more chances than Leverkusen, which was Bayern Munich.\nNow that we have been able to see that the offense was elite and they were able to create goal-scoring chances, let’s check the defense now.\nWe’ll look at the tackles won and tackles lost statistics using a dumbell chart.\n\n\nCode\ntacklesbundesliga&lt;- read_csv(\"data/tacklesbundesliga.csv\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=tacklesbundesliga, \n    aes(y=reorder(Squad, TklW), x=TklW, xend=Lost),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"Black\",\n    colour_x = \"Green\",\n    colour_xend = \"Red\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Tackles Difference\",\n    title=\"Leverkusen has elite defense...

This has me thinking, and what I have made from this is that not many teams were able to attack but when able to, they had trouble stopping them.\nThey were holding the ball a lot too in the opposing half of the field against opponents, which could also be the reason why they lost the least amount of tackles in the league. They somehow still won the most tackles, though.\nBayer Leverkusen was an amazing team in 23/24 but the defense at times was not great which led to goal-scoring and it caused Leverkusen to outshoot their opponents which they were great at."
