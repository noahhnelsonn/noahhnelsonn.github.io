This would mean that they were taking shots or given chances that they were not supposed to have and ended up converting on some of them. This also shows that they weren’t just relying on there defense and goalkeeper to win them games but the offense were able to cash in on some extra chances. They had three players score more than ten goals last season which was more than any other team in the Bundesliga."
