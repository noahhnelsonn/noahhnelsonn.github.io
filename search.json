    "text": "There is no doubt that Leverkusen had an unforgettable season in the 2023-2024 season. The Lions completed a perfect season and didn’t take a single loss throughout league play.\nSoccer phenomena have wondered how they accomplished this and have questioned the team’s legitimacy. Players like Victor Boniface, Florian Wirtz, and Bundesliga assist leader Alex Grimaldo led the elite offense.\nLet’s put this theory to the test.\nThe first we’ll look at is goals and expected goals to see how Leverkusen did compared to other squads in league play.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nbundesligagoals &lt;- read_csv(\"data/xpgoalsbundesliga.csv\")\n\nbundesligagoalswide &lt;- bundesligagoals |&gt; \n  group_by(Squad) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    Totalxg = sum(xG),\n    Totalgoals = sum(Gls)\n  )\n\nlongbundesliga &lt;- bundesligagoalswide |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Total\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"goals\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=longbundesliga, aes(x=reorder(Squad,goals), weight=goals, fill=Type)) +\n  coord_flip() + \n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = \"Legend\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"black\")) +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Goals\",\n    x = \"Squad\",\n    title = \"Bayer Leverkusen were hard to stop in league play\",\n    subtitle = \"The Lions have made the most out of there shot chances\",\n    caption=\"Source: www.FBRef.com | By: Noah Nelson\") +\n   theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank() \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayer Leverkusen has been able to convert more goals than what they were expected. This means that they were taking shots or given chances that they were not supposed to have and ended up converting on some of them.\nThe offense for Leverkusen can be described in one word: Elite.\nThe Lions were able to connect and were able to outscore their expected goals, and this would be pivotal towards their undefeated season.\nIt creates yet another question to test the reigning Bundesliga champion’s offense.\nHow often were they creating chances for themselves, and how many of the passes were able to lead to goal opportunities?\n\n\nCode\ngcabundesliga&lt;- read_csv(\"data/gcabundesliga.csv\")\ngcaleverkusen&lt;- gcabundesliga |&gt; filter(Squad==\"Leverkusen\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = gcabundesliga, aes(x = SCA, y = GCA),color=\"black\") + \n  geom_point(data = gcaleverkusen, aes(x = SCA, y = GCA),color=\"red\") +\n  geom_smooth(data = gcabundesliga, aes(x = SCA, y = GCA), method=\"lm\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=gcabundesliga, aes(x= SCA, y= GCA, label= Squad)) +\n    labs(title = \"Are the Lions creating shots and converting them?\",\n       subtitle = \"Creating chances were the least of Leverkusens worries in Bundesliga play \",\n       caption=\"Source: www.FBRef.com | By: Noah Nelson\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeverkusen were able to create chances for their elite offensive players, and from what the stats show, they were able to convert on most of the chances they were given.\nGCA is determined by looking at the two passes leading directly before a goal is scored, and SCA is determined by looking at the two passes leading to a shot. Only one team was able to create more chances than Leverkusen, which was Bayern Munich.\nNow that we have been able to see that the offense was elite and they were able to create goal-scoring chances, let’s check the defense now.\nWe’ll look at the tackles won and tackles lost statistics using a dumbell chart.\n\n\nCode\ntacklesbundesliga&lt;- read_csv(\"data/tacklesbundesliga.csv\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=tacklesbundesliga, \n    aes(y=reorder(Squad, TklW), x=TklW, xend=Lost),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"Black\",\n    colour_x = \"Green\",\n    colour_xend = \"Red\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Tackles Difference\",\n    title=\"Leverkusen has elite defense... Right?\",\n    subtitle = \"Having more &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;won tackles&lt;/span&gt; than &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;loss tackles&lt;/span&gt; are crucial when preventing goals.\",\n    y = \"\",\n    caption = \" Source: www.FBRef.com | By: Noah Nelson \"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\nWarning: Using the `size` aesthetic with geom_segment was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` aesthetic instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting.\nLeverkusen was last in the league in tackles won but lost the least amount of tackles at the same time. This has me thinking, and what I have made from this is that not many teams were able to attack but when able to, they had trouble stopping them.\nThey were holding the ball a lot too in the opposing half of the field against opponents, which could also be the reason why they lost the least amount of tackles in the league. They somehow still won the most tackles, though.\nBayer Leverkusen was an amazing team in 23/24 but the defense at times was not great which led to goal-scoring and it caused Leverkusen to outshoot their opponents which they were great at."
